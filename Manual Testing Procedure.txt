Manual Testing Procedure

1). Download Project Gutenberg text.
2). Strip non-book text including title and attribution.
3). Download included Librevox recordings of all chapters from Project Gutenberg. May source alternatively voiced reads from Librevox website for testing, model training, etc.
4). Strip all non-corresponding intro/title/attribution info in each chapter using an audio file editor such as audacity, etc.
5). Merge each chapter into a master audio file.
6). Play master audio using mic emulator. Do not run other audio on the system as the driver level emulation is system wide.
7). Download the transcript.
8). You may run my testing utility, or enter the transcript and master text into diffchecker. Save results.
9). When switching between multiple audio files, first refresh scribear and then cue the next file.
